# Object_detection_with_roboFlow
Object Detection Project â€” A Python and OpenCV-based system using two Roboflow models to detect multiple objects like persons, vehicles, zebra crossings, and traffic lights in videos. It merges model outputs, draws bounding boxes with labels, and generates a single analyzed video for efficient traffic and safety monitoring.
